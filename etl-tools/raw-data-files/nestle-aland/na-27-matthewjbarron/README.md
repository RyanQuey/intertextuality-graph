## What is this?

Presumably the old loci citati vel allegati from NA 27. 
- However, there are indications that the data is not perfectly correct (e.g., one row has OT passage of "where?", etc), and there are some rows where OT passage is "Genesis" for example, one for each book of OT and some extrabiblical books too.

## Use
Maybe won't use...?


## Steps to copy from the website and convert into CSV:
1) copy chart from here, including header: http://adfontespress.com/matthewjbarron/places-quoted-or-alluded-to-in-the-new-testament/
  - this makes the raw-chart.txt file
  - note that his headers in the chart are a little bit of a misnomer - "New Testament Passages" column includes OT allusions to OT...somehow. Not sure how there would be, given that this is a Greek NT. 
2) copy to new file
  ```
  cp raw-chart.txt na-27-allusions-quotations.csv
  ```
3) edit new file??
  - TODO make it same format as our expected CSVs for upload into app.

## Commtting into github
For now not committing these data files in public repo for copyright issues, just create and ingest manually.
